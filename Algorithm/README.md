# Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm project is structured into three main categories: **Drill**, **Homework**, and **Lecture**. Each category contains valuable resources and materials that facilitate learning and understanding of algorithms.

## Directory Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

```
├─ Drill
│  ├─ 2nd_Week
│  ├─ 3rd_Week
│  ├─ 4th_Week
│  ├─ 7th_Week
│  └─ Drill_Practice
│      ├─ 2nd_Week
│      ├─ 3rd_Week
│      ├─ 4th_Week
│      └─ Dynamic_Programming
├─ Homework
│  ├─ HW1
│  ├─ HW10
│  ├─ HW11
│  ├─ HW12
│  ├─ HW13
│  ├─ HW5
│  ├─ HW6
│  └─ HW9
└─ Lecture
    ├─ PDF
    └─ Summary
```

### Sections Explained

1. **Drill**:
   - This section includes practice problems completed during class sessions. 
   - Weekly directories (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th weeks) contain relevant drills.
   - The `Drill_Practice` folder features additional practice problems, including sections on dynamic programming.

2. **Homework**:
   - This section contains homework assignments given after classes. Each assignment is stored in a separate folder (e.g., HW1, HW10, HW11, etc.) for easy reference.

3. **Lecture**:
   - This section consolidates lecture materials from class.
   - The `PDF` folder includes lecture slides and resources.
   - The `Summary` folder provides concise summaries of the lecture content.

### Theory Materials

The following theoretical topics are covered through provided PDFs:

- **ch0.pdf** - Introduction to Algorithms
- **ch1.pdf** - Fundamental Concepts
- **ch2_divide_conquer.pdf** - Divide and Conquer Strategy
- **ch3_dynamic_programming.pdf** - Dynamic Programming Techniques
